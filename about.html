                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Kya, and I'm a German Shepherd Dog and Belgian Malinois mix.
                    I was born on January 8, 2023 in North Carolina. One of my ears is down,
                    so I only hear 50% of anything that is said to me. When I'm focused, I
                    can do lots of tricks, like sit, stay, and, my favorite, hug.
                </p>
                <h2>My Family</h2>
                <p>I have two dads who are the best! I also have a brother named Jackson who is a Husky Boxer mix.
                    He can be annoying sometimes, but he's my best friend in the whole world.
                    I also like to go play with my Auntie Bella who's a Labradoodle.
                </p>
                <h2>My Dreams</h2>
                <p>My biggest dream is to live a full life full of hiking and fun with my humans and dog siblings!
                    I also would love to catch a squirrel. If only I could climb up trees...
